**Save context now.** Update these before the session ends:

1. **Workspace** (`.meridian/WORKSPACE.md`)
   - Key decisions made and why
   - Important discoveries or blockers
   - Current state of work in progress
   - Anything hard to rediscover
   - Create workspace pages in `.meridian/workspace/` for larger topics — link them from `WORKSPACE.md`

2. **Pebble** (if enabled)
   - Update issue status
   - Add comments with progress
   - Create issues for discovered work

After updating, confirm what was saved.
