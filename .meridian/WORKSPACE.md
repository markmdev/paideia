# AI Teaching OS - Workspace

## Project Overview
Building a K-12 education platform for Anthropic hackathon. Five modules + Student AI Tutor, all in one Next.js web app.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (Supabase hosted via connection pooler)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js (Auth.js v5) with @auth/drizzle-adapter, JWT strategy, credentials provider
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API (Opus 4.6) via @anthropic-ai/sdk v0.74.0
- **Testing**: Vitest + API endpoint testing

## Supabase Config
- Project: teaching-os (us-west-2, IPv6-only, must use pooler)
- URL: https://qeayczyoaqttlwpstwbn.supabase.co
- DB via pooler (see .env for URLs)
- Credentials in .env (never committed)

## Epic: TEAC-w25zza

## Key Decisions
- No Chrome extension - unified web platform
- PostgreSQL via Supabase (deployment-ready)
- Anthropic API key stored in .env (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Creative Opus usage: tool_use for structured output, streaming for tutor, multi-step generation
- All coding delegated to sub-agents; orchestrator only verifies
- Frontend design skill applied: warm education-friendly aesthetics, no AI slop

## API Docs
- [Anthropic API](./api-docs/anthropic-api.md) - DONE (SDK v0.74.0, claude-opus-4-6)
- [Drizzle ORM](./api-docs/drizzle-orm.md) - DONE
- [Next.js Stack](./api-docs/nextjs-stack.md) - DONE

## Creative Opus Usage (12 Implemented)
1. **tool_use for structured output** — Rubrics, lesson plans, assignments, quizzes (forced tool_choice)
2. **Multi-step generation** — Smart Assignment Creator generates assignment + rubric + criteria + 3 differentiated versions in one call
3. **Streaming** — Real-time Socratic tutor responses (Phase 6)
4. **Prompt caching** — Rubrics reused across student grading (Phase 3)
5. **Batch grading** — Grade entire class at once with AI (Phase 3)
6. **IEP individualization** — Similarity detection flags cookie-cutter IEPs (Phase 4)
7. **Multilingual translation** — Native LLM translation for parent communication (Phase 5)
8. **District AI analyst** — Opus synthesizes aggregate data into narrative insights (Phase 7)
9. **Adaptive thinking** — District insights use extended thinking to reason through complex multi-metric data
10. **Exit ticket generation** — Formative assessment tool generates targeted quick-checks with tool_use
11. **Early warning interventions** — AI generates per-student intervention recommendations for at-risk students
12. **Batch report card narratives** — AI generates individualized narratives for entire classes

### Dev Server
Background task b7d8737 running `npm run dev` on localhost:3000.
Chrome tab ID: 1135439413.

### New Detail Pages — COMPLETE (Iteration 6)
Three new detail pages built by subagents, all verified in browser:
1. `/dashboard/classes/[classId]/page.tsx` — Teacher class detail (roster, assignments, standards analysis)
2. `/dashboard/schools/[schoolId]/page.tsx` — Admin school detail (teachers, classes tables)
3. `/dashboard/students/[studentId]/page.tsx` — Admin student detail (enrollment, mastery, submissions)

### Bugs Found & Fixed (Iteration 6)
- ✅ Early warning table overflow: `whitespace-normal` on Indicators cell and expanded intervention cell (shadcn TableCell has `whitespace-nowrap` default). Commit c1126f8.
- ✅ Student detail mastery table overflow: `overflow-x-auto` wrapper. Commit e64dc73.
- ✅ Student table: names made clickable to student detail page. Commit 61a88a7.

### Browser Testing (Iteration 6)
- ✅ Teacher: Early Warning — 22 students, 6 High/6 Moderate/10 On Track, expandable AI interventions wrap properly
- ✅ Teacher: Messages — type badges, compose dialog, message list with dates
- ✅ Teacher: Lesson Plan detail — markdown renders (bold, italic), grade/subject/duration badges
- ✅ Teacher: Class Detail (Period 1) — 7 students, 4 assignments, standards analysis, mobile responsive
- ✅ Admin: District Analytics — 6 stat cards, mastery distribution, avg scores, teacher engagement, AI Insights button
- ✅ Admin: Schools — 2 schools with avg scores, proper pluralization
- ✅ Admin: School Detail (Washington MS) — 3 teachers, 9 classes, 71% avg, classes table with subjects

- ✅ Student (Aisha): Dashboard, assignments, tutor hub — all working

### Fixed: Markdown table rendering (commit 6aec5bf)
Installed `remark-gfm` and added `remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}` + table styling components to all 8 files using ReactMarkdown. CER Framework table now renders as proper HTML table with borders and header styling.

### Bugs Found & Fixed (Iteration 6 continued)
53. ✅ Em dash spacing: "Great job —keep" → "Great job — keep" on student-progress page (5 instances, commit cfe78cd)
54. ✅ Cross-class mastery leakage: ELA class detail showed science standards (HS-LS1-3) in strengths. Fixed by filtering mastery records via standards.subject join (commit e197160)
55. 🔄 Double-dashes in seed data content (messages, essays, feedback) — fix delegated to background agent ac339e8
56. ⚠️ Admin student detail: mastery level badges clipped on right edge ("Profici...", "Advanc...") — needs wider column or shorter text
57. ⚠️ Duplicate "Symbols Speak Louder Than Words" draft assignments in DB (from AI testing) — data clutter, not code bug

### Browser Testing (Iteration 6 continued)
- ✅ Student: Progress page — em dashes fixed ("Great job — keep it up!")
- ✅ Teacher: Messages — compose dialog with To dropdown (Sarah Chen, Marcus Williams), subject, message textarea, Send button
- ✅ Teacher: My Classes — 5 periods, click through to class detail
