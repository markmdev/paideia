# Project-level configuration for the Claude workflow

# Project type affects which code guide add-on is loaded:
# - hackathon   → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_HACKATHON.md
# - standard    → baseline only
# - production  → use CODE_GUIDE_ADDON_PRODUCTION.md
project_type: standard

# Plan review: require plan-reviewer agent before exiting plan mode.
# When false, ExitPlanMode proceeds without review.
plan_review_enabled: true

# Plan review minimum actions: Skip plan-reviewer if fewer than this many actions
# occurred since entering plan mode. Prevents heavyweight review for quick plans.
# Set to 0 to always enforce.
plan_review_min_actions: 20

# Code review: require code-reviewer agent before stopping.
# When false, code review is skipped.
code_review_enabled: true

# Pre-compaction sync: prompt agent to save context before conversation compacts.
# When false, no warning is given before compaction.
pre_compaction_sync_enabled: true

# Token threshold for pre-compaction sync warning (default: 150000).
pre_compaction_sync_threshold: 144000

# Auto-compact off: When true, agent stops after pre-compaction sync
# instead of allowing auto-compaction. User must run /clear manually.
# This gives you control over when sessions reset.
auto_compact_off: false

# Folders to ignore for CLAUDE.md review suggestions.
# When agent modifies files, stop hook suggests reviewing CLAUDE.md files
# on the path to those files. These folders are excluded.
# Default: .git, .meridian, node_modules, __pycache__, .venv, venv, dist, build
# claudemd_ignored_folders:
#   - .git
#   - .meridian
#   - node_modules
#   - vendor

# Workspace: Agent's living knowledge base (WORKSPACE.md root file).
# The root file is trimmed when over this limit.
# Set to 0 to disable trimming (unlimited size).

# Pebble integration: Git-backed graph issue tracker for AI agents.
# When enabled, agent MUST actively use Pebble to manage work.
# See PEBBLE_GUIDE.md for command reference and principles.
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/pebble
pebble_enabled: true

# Stop hook minimum actions: Skip stop hook prompts if fewer than this many
# tool calls occurred since the user's last input. Prevents interruption
# on quick/simple tasks. Set to 0 to always run stop hook.

# Pebble scaffolder: Auto-invoke pebble-scaffolder after plan approval.
# When false, you can use Pebble without automatic issue scaffolding.

# Docs researcher write requirement: Block docs-researcher if it didn't write files.
# When false, docs-researcher can complete without writing to api-docs.
