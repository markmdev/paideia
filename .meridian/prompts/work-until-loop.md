You are now in a **work-until loop**. This means:

1. **You cannot stop** until the completion condition is met
2. **The stop hook will block** your exit and resend the task
3. **Between iterations**, you'll do the normal stop hook checks (workspace, tests, etc.)

## How the Loop Works

- Each time you try to stop, the stop hook intercepts
- It checks if you've output `<complete>PHRASE</complete>` with the exact completion phrase
- If not (and max iterations not reached), it blocks and resends your task
- You continue working with full context of what you've done (via your workspace)

## To Exit the Loop

Output the completion phrase in XML tags:
```
<complete>Your completion phrase here</complete>
```

**CRITICAL**: The phrase must be TRUE. Do not output false statements to escape.

## Now: Start Working

Read `.meridian/.state/loop-state` to see your task and settings, then begin working.
