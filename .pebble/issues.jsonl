If the model changes, this route will be missed.\n\n3. **Duplicated tool schema**: Defines the entire Smart Assignment tool schema inline (~100 lines, lines 79-183) despite `src/lib/ai/generate-assignment.ts` already implementing `generateSmartAssignment()` with the same tool schema in a richer, more detailed form with better prompt engineering.

The AI service layer exists specifically to encapsulate Claude API calls, but this route circumvents it entirely.

Malformed JSON in the database would crash the route handler with an unhandled error.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n1. **Maintenance cost**: Changing how any JSON field is structured requires finding every JSON.parse/stringify call for that field across multiple files\n2. **Type erosion**: The `as Record<string, string>` and `as string[]` casts trust that the stored JSON matches the expected shape with no runtime validation\n3. **Error handling gap**: Any corrupted JSON value in the database causes a 500 error with no helpful context\n4. **Verbosity**: 60+ parse calls add noise that obscures the business logic\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nCreate parse/serialize helpers for each structured column type, grouped by domain. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// src/lib/db/json-fields.ts\nexport function parseLessonPlanFields(plan: typeof lessonPlans.$inferSelect) {\n  return {\n    ...plan,\n    standards: safeParseArray(plan.standards),\n    objectives: safeParseArray(plan.objectives),\n    materials: safeParseArray(plan.materials),\n    differentiation: safeParseJson(plan.differentiation),\n    aiMetadata: safeParseJson(plan.aiMetadata),\n  }\n}\n\nfunction safeParseArray(json: string | null): string[] {\n  if (!json) return []\n  try { return JSON.parse(json) } catch { return [] }\n}\n\nfunction safeParseJson<T>(json: string | null): T | null {\n  if (!json) return null\n  try { return JSON.parse(json) } catch { return null }\n}\n```\n\nThis centralizes the parsing, adds error resilience, and makes the route handlers cleaner.","parent":"TEAC-w25zza"},"source":"teaching-os"}

The dynamic import of \\`classes\\` is inconsistent and unnecessary -- it is not conditionally loaded for performance or code-splitting reasons (this is a server-side API route).\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nDynamic imports in API routes do not provide code-splitting benefits (server-side code is not bundled for the browser). The pattern obscures the file's dependencies -- a developer scanning the imports at the top of the file will not see that \\`classes\\` is also used. It also introduces an unnecessary async operation.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd \\`classes\\` to the existing static import at the top of the file:\n\n\\`\\`\\`ts\nimport {\n  users,\n  classMembers,\n  masteryRecords,\n  submissions,\n  assignments,\n  classes,  // add this\n} from '@/lib/db/schema'\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThen remove the dynamic import on line 46.","parent":"TEAC-w25zza"},"source":"teaching-os"}

The `sql<number>` Drizzle type annotation is compile-time only and does NOT coerce the value.\n\nThe fix added `Number()` coercion in `src/app/dashboard/iep/page.tsx` (lines 151, 152, 171, 172), but the exact same `sql<number>` + `count(*)` pattern is used in 40+ other locations across the codebase that remain unfixed:\n\n- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — 15 count queries used for dashboard stats\n- `src/app/dashboard/grading/page.tsx` — totalCount, gradedCount, ungradedCount used in display and arithmetic\n- `src/app/dashboard/report-cards/page.tsx` — count, totalCount, draftCount, approvedCount\n- `src/app/api/admin/overview/route.ts` — 10+ count queries returned in JSON\n- `src/app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts` — count queries for mastery distribution\n- `src/app/api/admin/teachers/route.ts` — 4 count queries\n- `src/app/api/admin/students/route.ts` — count query\n- `src/app/api/admin/schools/route.ts` — count query\n- `src/app/api/admin/insights/route.ts` — 10+ count queries\n- `src/app/api/iep/route.ts` — goalCount\n\n## Impact\n\nWhere counts are used in strict equality (`!== 1` for pluralization), string \"1\" !== number 1, causing incorrect pluralization. Where counts are used in arithmetic or comparisons, JavaScript loose coercion may mask the bug in some cases but fail in others. API responses serialize string counts as `\"5\"` instead of `5`, which may break frontend consumers expecting numbers.\n\n## Fix\n\nEither:\n1. Apply `Number()` coercion at every usage site (tedious, error-prone)\n2. Use `cast(count(*) as int)` in the SQL template — this makes PostgreSQL return an integer which postgres.js delivers as a JS number: `sql<number>\\`cast(count(*) as int)\\``\n3. Create a helper: `const countSql = sql<number>\\`cast(count(*) as int)\\`` and use it everywhere\n\nOption 2 or 3 is the systematic fix. The Drizzle ORM docs at `.meridian/api-docs/drizzle-orm.md:829` even show this pattern.\n\n## Evidence\n\nThe IEP page fix proves the bug exists. The same `sql<number>\\`count(*)\\`` pattern without coercion exists in all files listed above.","parent":"TEAC-y2fott"},"source":"teaching-os"}

The ComposeMessage dialog could use MessageCompose internally as the form content, adding the dialog wrapper and contact picker on top.","parent":"TEAC-w25zza"},"source":"teaching-os"}
